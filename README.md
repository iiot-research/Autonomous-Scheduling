# Autonomous-Scheduling
Codes and data of autonomous transmission scheduling for TSCH networks

We develop ATRIA, a novel Autonomous Traffic-Aware transmission scheduling method for industrial WSANs. Each device can schedule its transmissions to meet its traffic demand without exchanging information with its neighboring devices. Our methdod provides higher end-to-end network reliability and lower end-to-end latency without introducing additional overhead.

# ATRIA
We implement ATRIA based on Contiki and evaluate its performance o physical testbed that is composed of M3 devices.
